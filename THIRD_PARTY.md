## Android and JVM runtime

The release runtime graph includes the following license families. Test-only dependencies are not
shipped in the app and must be inventoried separately if test artifacts are distributed.

| Components | License |
| --- | --- |
| AndroidX, Jetpack Compose, Material icons, Navigation, Tink, Gson, JSpecify, Guava ListenableFuture | Apache-2.0 |
| Kotlin, kotlinx.coroutines, kotlinx.serialization, AtomicFU | Apache-2.0 |
| OkHttp and Okio | Apache-2.0 |
| Haze | Apache-2.0 |
| Eclipse JGit | Eclipse Distribution License 1.0 |
| JavaEWAH and Apache Commons Codec | Apache-2.0 |
| SLF4J | MIT |

The resolved release graph must be exported into the release SBOM and checked against this table for
every release. A dependency-family summary is not a substitute for the final component-level SBOM
and license bundle.

## Mermaid 10.9.6 bundle

- File: `app/src/main/assets/mermaid.min.js`
- SHA-256: `eda3a0ad572bbe69a318c1be0163e8233dd824f3f12939e5168feba207767151`
- Exact origin: `mermaid@10.9.6`, `dist/mermaid.min.js`, npm package integrity
  `sha512-XRjjRaI4aPCAMpVaOhxIwLYdx3U4Cb6mN0M268ggFAfFRqsvyFW8zxWbEZazN/mPkqsVWThb0oa1UawWK+XMNg==`
- Mermaid license: MIT, Copyright (c) 2014-2022 Knut Sveidqvist

The committed bytes match the published npm package exactly. The single-file build embeds Mermaid's
runtime dependencies, including sanitize-url, Cytoscape, D3, dagre-d3-es, Day.js, DOMPurify, ELK,
KaTeX, khroma, Lodash, mdast utilities, Stylis, UUID, and related transitive code. Their exact resolved
versions and notices are not present in this repository. This pinned backport includes the Mermaid
11.15.0 security fixes for CVE-2026-41148, CVE-2026-41149, CVE-2026-41150, and CVE-2026-41159.
Publish its generated third-party-notice inventory before release.

## Alpine 3.21.7 development root filesystem

- File: `app/src/main/assets/alpine-aarch64.rootfs`
- SHA-256: `d1d1a3fae5f4d6146e9742790a47fcb116199622cfb8439f218a4d5fbe5000da`
- Exact binary origin:
  `https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.21/releases/aarch64/alpine-minirootfs-3.21.7-aarch64.tar.gz`

The root filesystem's installed-package database records:

| Package | Version | Source package | Declared license |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| alpine-baselayout, alpine-baselayout-data | 3.6.8-r1 | alpine-baselayout | GPL-2.0-only |
| alpine-keys | 2.5-r0 | alpine-keys | MIT |
| alpine-release | 3.21.7-r0 | alpine-base | MIT |
| apk-tools | 2.14.6-r3 | apk-tools | GPL-2.0-only |
| busybox, busybox-binsh, ssl_client | 1.37.0-r14 | busybox | GPL-2.0-only |
| ca-certificates-bundle | 20260413-r0 | ca-certificates | MPL-2.0 AND MIT |
| libcrypto3, libssl3 | 3.3.7-r0 | openssl | Apache-2.0 |
| musl | 1.2.5-r11 | musl | MIT |
| musl-utils | 1.2.5-r11 | musl | MIT AND BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-or-later |
| scanelf | 1.3.8-r1 | pax-utils | GPL-2.0-only |
| zlib | 1.3.2-r0 | zlib | Zlib |

The minirootfs does not include complete corresponding source or the complete license bundle for
these packages. An upstream binary URL alone does not satisfy PhoneCode's obligations as a binary
redistributor. Do not distribute this rootfs until the exact source archives, Alpine build recipes
and patches, license texts, and a machine-readable SBOM are published beside the artifact.

## PRoot development prototype

- Files: `app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libproot.so` and `libproot-loader.so`
- Licenses represented in the binaries: PRoot GPL-2.0-or-later and talloc LGPL-3.0-or-later
- Detailed audit: `app/src/main/jniLibs/PROVENANCE.md`

The committed hashes do not match the formerly cited upstream build archive. Complete corresponding
source and reproducible build inputs are missing. These binaries are not distributable until they
are removed or replaced with a fully traceable build.

## Planned VM runtime

QEMU, the Linux kernel, the initramfs, and their linked dependency closure are not currently packaged
in the app. Their proof-of-concept files in `/tmp` are not release artifacts. Before adding any of
them, publish complete corresponding source, all Android changes, reproducible build scripts,
toolchain versions, license texts, an SPDX or CycloneDX SBOM, and final artifact hashes. QEMU must
remain a separate executable process rather than being linked into PhoneCode.

## Release status

The current release gate remains closed. The exact blockers and remediation procedure are in
`legal/RELEASE_COMPLIANCE.md`.
