# Bundled native binaries - provenance

These are prebuilt third-party binaries vendored into `jniLibs` (the only place Android lets an app
exec a binary from - see `EnvironmentBootstrap`). Each is verifiable against the source below: re-fetch
from the pinned commit and compare the SHA-256.

## proot (Linux userland via PRoot) - arm64-v8a only

- **What:** `libproot.so` is PRoot (userspace chroot+bind via ptrace); `libproot-loader.so` is its
  statically-linked loader. Together they run a full Alpine Linux rootfs on-device under Android's W^X
  (`mmap PROT_EXEC` survives where `execve` is denied), so `apk add python3 ...` works.
- **Source:** https://github.com/green-green-avk/build-proot-android (the PRoot build behind the
  AnotherTerm terminal app's "Linux under PRoot" feature).
- **Pinned build commit:** `01f83b8841358450c78333d1b33ab30d4943bec4` (2023-06-23), using PRoot `0.15_release` and talloc `2.4.3`.
- **Build toolchain:** Android NDK `28.2.13676358`, with 16 KB ELF page alignment for Android 15+ compatibility.
- **Files + SHA-256 (verified at vendor time):**
  - `root/bin/proot` -> `arm64-v8a/libproot.so` -> `42a0313a04296d913279c55eccabf9082d31d0f8caf1960079d92342c4629e0c`
  - `root/libexec/proot/loader` -> `arm64-v8a/libproot-loader.so` -> `12d2b63e897fd91a334fce23edea5d2419cae4d5fd2a369f05d03ab75682add0`
- **Licenses:** PRoot (GPL-2.0), talloc (LGPL-3.0) - see the source repo.
- **Scope:** arm64-v8a only. Other ABIs intentionally have no proot and fall back to busybox at runtime
  (`EnvironmentBootstrap.buildLinux` returns null), keeping the unaudited-binary surface minimal.
- **Residual risk:** the binaries are built from pinned upstream source outside this repository and
  committed by hash. Rebuild and compare them when upgrading the NDK, PRoot, or talloc.

To verify the committed files:

    shasum -a 256 arm64-v8a/libproot.so arm64-v8a/libproot-loader.so
    llvm-readelf -lW arm64-v8a/libproot.so arm64-v8a/libproot-loader.so

## busybox - arm64-v8a

- **What:** `arm64-v8a/libbusybox.so` is a static aarch64 busybox - the on-device POSIX shell toolkit,
  invoked through a `busybox`-named symlink and per-applet symlinks. (The previous arm64 binary was
  mistakenly a 32-bit ARM build, which does not run on arm64-only devices and broke the whole shell.)
- **Source:** Alpine Linux `busybox-static` package, v3.21 aarch64.
- **Pinned:** `busybox-static-1.37.0-r14.apk`, file `bin/busybox.static`.
- **SHA-256:** `e383c8bc25a1137b8ee88718cc6df1f1e84c54521d6045fc837385995dcdf031`
- **License:** GPL-2.0.
- The armeabi-v7a and x86_64 busybox binaries are pre-existing and the correct architecture for their ABI.

    curl -fsSL https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.21/main/aarch64/busybox-static-1.37.0-r14.apk | tar -xz
    shasum -a 256 bin/busybox.static
